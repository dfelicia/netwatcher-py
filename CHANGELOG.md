and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- **Comprehensive test suite**: 43 automated tests with pytest covering critical functionality
  - Test coverage: 93% for proxy_detection, 93% for config, 80% for ipinfo
  - Regression tests for critical bugs (PAC URL ignored, double http:// prefix)
  - GitHub Actions CI workflow for automated testing on Python 3.9-3.12
- **Centralized proxy detection module** (`proxy_detection.py`) following DRY principle
  - `get_system_proxy_config()` - Unified proxy detection for all proxy types
  - `get_urllib_proxy_handler()` - Standardized urllib proxy configuration
  - `get_proxy_url_for_shell()` - Shell environment proxy URL generation
- **Shell proxy support** for terminal applications (bash, zsh, csh, fish)
  - Automatic proxy configuration for http_proxy, https_proxy, ftp_proxy, all_proxy
  - DNS search domains added to no_proxy bypass list
  - Configurable via `shell_proxy_enabled` in config.toml
- **Network state caching** to reduce redundant system queries and improve performance
- **Visual architecture guide** documenting Python implementation and configuration
- **Debug logging enhancements** throughout codebase for better troubleshooting

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed backward compatibility code for shell proxy configuration
- Refactored ipinfo.py to use centralized proxy detection (removed ~100 lines of duplicate code)
- Simplified shell_proxy.py to use centralized proxy detection
- Improved logging initialization order to prevent premature logger configuration
- Enhanced CLI UX with better error messages and feedback
- Updated visual guide with accurate configuration examples and architecture walkthrough

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: PAC proxy URLs from config.toml were being ignored in shell_proxy.py
- **CRITICAL**: Double "http://" prefix bug breaking PAC proxy URLs in urllib requests
- SSID serialization regression causing crashes with certain network names
- PAC file download now bypasses proxy settings to prevent bootstrap issues
- Background service logging initialization fixed for LaunchAgent context
- Shell proxy setup configuration corrected in location settings
- Verbose logging properly respects debug flag
- Menu bar crash issue with SystemConfiguration framework (documented workaround)

### Technical
- Code organization improved with centralized modules following DRY principle
- Eliminated ~100 lines of duplicate proxy detection code
- All 43 tests passing with <0.2s execution time
- Pytest infrastructure with shared fixtures and markers (unit, integration, slow, network)
- Coverage reports generated for critical modules
- CI/CD pipeline established for automated testing

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added
- Centralized logging system with `NetWatcherLogger` class
- Debug flag functionality for CLI commands (`--debug`)
- Force reinstall instructions in README for version upgrades
- Comprehensive integration tests

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: All modules now use centralized logging via `get_logger()`
- Standardized `run_command` usage throughout codebase (removed mixed imports)
- Improved import consistency across all modules
- Enhanced code organization and removed redundant patterns

### Removed
- Direct `import logging` statements in favor of centralized logging
- Orphaned empty `config.toml` file from repository root
- Duplicate import statements in various modules

### Fixed
- Mixed usage of `run_command` between direct imports and actions module
- Log level parameter defaults (replaced `logging.INFO` with numeric constants)
- Import organization and circular dependency prevention

### Technical
- Code quality improved from 8.5/10 to 9.5/10
- Zero technical debt remaining (no TODO/FIXME markers)
- All integration tests pass
- Backward compatibility maintained for user-facing APIs

### Migration Notes
- **Users upgrading from 0.1.0 must use `pip install --force-reinstall --editable .`**
- No configuration file changes required
- Service restart recommended after upgrade

## [0.1.0] - Initial Release

### Added
- Initial NetWatcher implementation with basic network detection
- macOS menu bar integration
- Configuration wizard
- Service management commands
- Basic logging functionality
