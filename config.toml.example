# Location Definitions
# --------------------
# Define your different network locations here. The application will try to match
# the current network against each location in the order they are defined.
# The first location that matches will be used.
#
# You can match based on Wi-Fi SSIDs or DNS search domains.
# To add multiple values, use the array syntax: ssids = ["SSID1", "SSID2"]

# Default Fallback Location
# -------------------------
# The 'default' location is special. If the current network does not match any
# of the locations defined above, the settings from this section will be applied.
# This is useful for ensuring a consistent state on unknown networks.

# VPN Detection
# -------------
# VPN detection is automatic - no manual configuration required.
# NetWatcher will automatically detect VPN connections and display status
# information for supported VPN clients (Cisco, etc.).
